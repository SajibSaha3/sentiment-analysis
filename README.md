<h1>🛍️ Sentiment Analysis on E-commerce Product Feedback</h1>

  <h2>🧾 Overview</h2>
  <p>
    This project focuses on analyzing customer feedback on an e-commerce platform to determine the sentiment expressed in each review.
    The goal is to build a machine learning model that can automatically classify a product review as either <strong>positive (1)</strong> or <strong>negative (0)</strong>.
    Understanding customer sentiment helps businesses enhance product quality, improve customer satisfaction, and make data-driven decisions.
  </p>

  <h2>📊 Dataset Description</h2>
  <p>The dataset used for this project consists of thousands of real customer product reviews collected from an e-commerce platform. Each review includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Text</strong>: The actual feedback written by the customer.</li>
    <li><strong>Label</strong>: A binary label where <code>1</code> indicates a positive sentiment and <code>0</code> indicates a negative sentiment.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The dataset is divided into training and testing subsets to evaluate the model's ability to generalize on unseen data.</p>

  <h2>🔍 Project Goals</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To preprocess and vectorize textual data using TF-IDF with n-gram features.</li>
    <li>To train a classification model that can accurately predict the sentiment of customer reviews.</li>
    <li>To evaluate the model using standard classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>📌 Feature Engineering</h2>
  <p>
    Text data is converted into numerical format using the <strong>TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)</strong> method.
    This approach evaluates how important a word or phrase is to a document in a collection.
  </p>
  <p>Key configuration:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>N-gram Range</strong>: Unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams (<code>(1,3)</code>) are used to capture more context from the text.</li>
    <li><strong>Custom Tokenization</strong>: Words are split based on whitespace to retain the natural structure of user reviews.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This technique allows the model to consider not only individual words but also combinations of words, which is useful for detecting phrases like "not good" or "very satisfied."</p>

  <h2>🧠 Model Selection</h2>
  <p>
    A <strong>Logistic Regression</strong> model was chosen for this binary classification task due to its simplicity, interpretability,
    and strong performance on high-dimensional text data.
  </p>
  <p>
    Logistic Regression is well-suited for tasks where the goal is to estimate probabilities and draw a clear decision boundary between classes.
  </p>
  <p>The model was trained on the TF-IDF features extracted from the training set and evaluated on the test set.</p>

  <h2>📈 Model Performance</h2>
  <p>After training, the model achieved high performance across all key evaluation metrics:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Accuracy</strong>: 98%</li>
    <li><strong>Precision</strong>: 98% (both classes)</li>
    <li><strong>Recall</strong>: 98% (both classes)</li>
    <li><strong>F1-Score</strong>: 98% (both classes)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These results indicate that the model is highly effective at distinguishing between positive and negative feedback,
    with minimal misclassification.
  </p>

  <h2>🛠️ Future Work</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Expand the model to support <strong>multi-class sentiment analysis</strong> (e.g., positive, neutral, negative).</li>
    <li>Incorporate <strong>deep learning models</strong> such as LSTM or BERT for more nuanced language understanding.</li>
    <li>Deploy the model as a <strong>REST API</strong> or integrate it into the frontend of an e-commerce platform for real-time analysis.</li>
    <li>Include <strong>explainability tools</strong> (e.g., SHAP or LIME) to interpret model predictions.</li>
  </ul>
